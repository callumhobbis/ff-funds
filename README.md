# Mindful Money Technical Challenge

This is my submission for the Mindful Money technical challenge as part of their interview process. You'll find my solutions to the tasks in `notebooks/match_companies.ipynb`. This notebook imports the `fffunds` package which contains some useful functions for matching company names and a very barebones framework for future work (the `Company` and `Fund` classes).

You can find my notes for future work at `docs/future-work.md`, and the test details can be found at `docs/challenge.md`.
